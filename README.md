TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Problem Statement:
Iris flower has three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

TASK 2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Problem Statement:
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

TASK 5: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Problem Statement:

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based businesses always need a Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So let's start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python. 
Sales prediction based on advertising expenditure features such as TV, newspaper, and radio.
